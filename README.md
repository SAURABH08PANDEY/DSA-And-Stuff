# Rules
- always make a new branch to add a solution. branch name should follow the convention "coding-platform-name/question-title" (ie: leetcode/plus-one)
- every solution must have question link along with the submission link of your solution on the top of the file.
- If you have a question which is not a part of any codeing platform, pls comment the question as well in the file. Branch name in such cases must follow the convention "unsorted/whatever-title-you-feel-like-giving
